## What is it?
The Shooting Watch is a self-proclaimed "rapid-fire measurement device".
Essentially, it's a watch that's been put into a game controller. The main feature
measures **how fast you can hit the A and B buttons within 10 seconds**.

It was originally created by the game company **Hudson Soft** (now owned by Konami) in **1987**.
Hudson Soft released many gaming peripherals with rapid-fire as the main selling point, and 
was advertised for use in shooting games (what we call **shoot-'em-ups** outside of Japan) they developed,
including **Star Force and Star Soldier**.

Hudson Soft and their products became widely famous thanks to the efforts of Takahashi Meijin, or Master Takahashi (real name Toshiyuki Takahashi).
He was the face of Hudson's marketing in their prime and became a celebrity amongst kids, appearing in comic books and television shows.
He even stars in the Japanese version of Hudson's game series **Adventure Island**.

Takahashi Meijin is however best known for his insanely fast trigger finger, once capable of hitting a button around **16 times per second**!
The Shooting Watch tasks you with standing up to the master himself: can you surpass the 16 shot limit?
